# Re-executing failed jobs in airflow

From time to time, jobs may fail for a number of reasons. By monitoring the logs, often time we can identify the cause of an error in the application package or data. There are times, however, when errors are transient and a simple retry can fix the issue. By default, the airflow deployments retry failed tasks.

The default setup in airflow is to retry tasks two times before failing.
