# Unity Account and Login

{% hint style="info" %}
**PREREQUISITE**:  The project account, users, roles, etc.. must be setup first, by the MDPS support team using the [Project Onboarding Procedure](project-onboarding-procedure.md).
{% endhint %}

### Logging in for the first time

1. When a new account is created you will receive an email with a temporary password. It will come from `no-reply@verificationemail.com`. If you did not receive this email please let the support team know.
2. Go to the Portal (e.g., [https://www.mdps.mcp.nasa.gov:4443/emit/dev/ui](https://www.mdps.mcp.nasa.gov:4443/emit/dev/ui)).  You may see a warning which you can bypass using your browser's normal process.\

3. You should see the login prompt. Use the username and password that were emailed to you. \

4. You should be immediately asked to change your password. Please do so.

### Reset your Password

If you forget your password or need to reset it for some reason:

1. Go to the login page for the environment that you want to work in, e.g. [https://unitysds-test.auth.us-west-2.amazoncognito.com/login?client\_id=59hp9flt6hm7k2nvacqhudqpl2\&response\_type=code\&scope=email+openid+profile\&redirect\_uri=https://jupyter-test-alb-1633047587.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8000/hub/oauth\_callback](https://unitysds-test.auth.us-west-2.amazoncognito.com/login?client_id=59hp9flt6hm7k2nvacqhudqpl2\&response_type=code\&scope=email+openid+profile\&redirect_uri=https://jupyter-test-alb-1633047587.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8000/hub/oauth_callback)
2. Select the "Forgot your password?" option, then
3. Enter your user name and press the button "Reset my password".&#x20;
4. That will send a code to your email, which can be used to change the password.
