# Getting Started

This page will cover the following topics

* Getting Access to the Unity-SDS system
* Logging in for the first time

### Logging In

Detailed instructions can be found here [unity-account-and-login.md](unity-account-and-login.md "mention")

1. Open the following URL in a web browser:  [https://jupyter-venue-test-alb-92992455.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8000/](https://jupyter-venue-test-alb-92992455.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8000/)
2. The next step is to clone the [sounder-sips-tutorial code repository](https://github.com/unity-sds/sounder-sips-tutorial) into your jupyter notebook, and follow along with the tutorials. The README in the code repo (link above) has instructions on how to clone it into the Jupyter environment. **Note** if you are in the unity test venue, you should be using the **develop** **branch** of the notebooks.

### Next Steps

TBD: See [Tutorials](tutorials/) for key next steps to follow.
