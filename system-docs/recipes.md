# Recipes

Many projects need to do similar things while adding their own project specific information or processing to a given step. In this section we describe some common use cases and how they can be accomplished within the Unity System.

* Cataloging a file as it is delivered (e.g. from a ground data system)
* After a file is delivered and cataloged, execute some processing
* Making large Auxiliary files needed during processing available
* Archiving products at a DAAC
* Manually uploading and cataloging data for use within the Unity System
