# Project/Venue Deployment

At a high-level deploying a project venue is accomplished by:

1. Identifying which Shared Services account to use, and [creating one if necessary](https://unity-sds.gitbook.io/docs/developer-docs/common-services/docs/users-guide/deployment/shared-services-deployment).
2. Following the [Project Onboarding Procedure](https://unity-sds.gitbook.io/docs/mdps-overview/project-onboarding-procedure)
