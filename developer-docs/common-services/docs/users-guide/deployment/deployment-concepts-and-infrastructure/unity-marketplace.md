# Unity Marketplace

[https://github.com/unity-sds/unity-marketplace](https://github.com/unity-sds/unity-marketplace)

## Prerequisites

coming soon..

## Procedure for Adding a Component to the Marketplace

1. **Create a repository** that houses code/scripts that do a deployment (e.g. terraform, CloudFormation, and/or shell scripts)
2. **Structure the repository** to have the correct entry point directory (e.g. `terraform-unity`).  There is an option to override the `terraform-unity` directory convention (i.e. in the case where multiple source repos lead to the marketplace deployment).
3. **Create a release** (zip file of the repository).  This should be put in your Github "Releases", in your repo, that can be referenced by a SHA.
4. Fork the [marketplace repo](https://github.com/unity-sds/unity-marketplace)
5. **Add your application**
   1. Under the `applications` directory, create a directory, and version sub-directory for your application.&#x20;
      1. See examples here:  [https://github.com/unity-sds/unity-marketplace/tree/main/applications](https://github.com/unity-sds/unity-marketplace/tree/main/applications)
   2. Create a metadata.json file for your application.  There is an example [here](https://github.com/unity-sds/unity-marketplace/blob/main/applications/sample-application/0.1/metadata.json).&#x20;
      1. [See notes here, about the schema](unity-marketplace.md#marketplace-metadata.json-specification)
6. **Submit your PR** to the [marketplace repo](https://github.com/unity-sds/unity-marketplace)
7. Ensure the checks pass
   1. (Doesn't exist yet, but in the future, there will be a CI/CD system that checks for validity)
8. Merge the PR
9. Application is available!
   1. The application should now be able to be deployed via the Management Console UI.
10. If you want to create a new version of your application in the Marketplace, you would repeat steps 4-9 above.
