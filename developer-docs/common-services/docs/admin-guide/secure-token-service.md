# Secure Token Service

For users without access to an MCP account, the MDPS Admins can generate a short term token that allows specific access to underlying services. This allows interaction for a brief amount of time to do the following:

* Read and Write to the venue S3 data bucket
* Create repositories in ECR
* Read and Write containers to a private ECR Repository.

### Generate a Token

Requirements:&#x20;

* The Admin must have access to the MCP Account via short-term access keys
* The role and associated IAM policies must already be created

to generate the token, the MDPS admin user must first have access to interact with the AWS Resources. These short-term access keys can be generated for the account in question via the MCP Kion dashboard.

Once access has been configured, run the following command:

```
aws sts assume-role --role-arn <role-arn> --role-session-name <random-unique-session-id> --external-id <external-id>
```

* \<role-arn> is the arn of the role for which the user is getting access. This should generally look like `arn:aws:iam:<account-id>:role/unity-<project>-<venue>-sts`
* A \<random-unique-session-id>. This can be anything, but should incldue the name of the user this token is for and a date or time stamp. e.g. unityuser12252025
* The \<external-id> is configured as part of the role itself, and is meant to prevent "confused deputy" problem, in which a user might accidentally request the resources of another project/venue. This is currently not given to the end user (for now), but is used as a secondary, sanity check that we're generating a token for the correct account. The external-id can be found in the IAM role policy document, or in an SSM parameter called `/unity/{project}/{venue}/cs/sts/role/external-id.`Ideally the external-id is provided by the &#x72;_&#x65;questing user_ to ensure access to the rol&#x65;_._

The result of the call is a json object with a few items:

```

The entire json should be sent to a user via LFT or some other secure, encrypted email service. **Do not send this via slack or email**, as it is sensitive information.
