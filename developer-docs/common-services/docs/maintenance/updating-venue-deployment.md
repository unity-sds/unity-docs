# Updating Venue Deployment

1. **Prerequisite**:  Have a EC2 bastion host on the venue account you wish to update.  See [instructions here](https://unity-sds.gitbook.io/docs/developer-docs/common-services/docs/users-guide/deployment/deployment-concepts-and-infrastructure/detailed-breakdown-of-project-onboarding-steps), to create one, if one doesn't exist alread&#x79;**.**
2. **Un-deploy SPS** (due to security group dependencies).
   1. Make sure SPS also un-deploys the EKS component.
3.  Log into the Management Console, and check what is deployed currently (e.g. the "Application Management" page).  If the `Unity-DS-Application`module is deployed, and present in the terraform state file, disconnect the U-DS marketplace-deployed module, for example:

    ```sh
    $ terraform state rm module.Unity-DS-Application-tdGjK
    Removed module.Unity-DS-Application-tdGjK.aws_s3_bucket.market_bucket
    Successfully removed 1 resource instance(s).
    ```
4. Destroy Management Console via bastion host.  See [instructions here](https://unity-sds.gitbook.io/docs/developer-docs/common-services/docs/users-guide/deployment/deployment-concepts-and-infrastructure/detailed-breakdown-of-project-onboarding-steps). (execute the `destroy.sh`script under step 11)
5. Deploy new Management Console via bastion host.   See [instructions here](https://unity-sds.gitbook.io/docs/developer-docs/common-services/docs/users-guide/deployment/deployment-concepts-and-infrastructure/detailed-breakdown-of-project-onboarding-steps). (execute the `run.sh` script)
6. Open the Management Console in a browser, go to the "Core Management" page, click "Save", then wait 1 minute.
7.  Manually update the shared services API Gateway Integration "Endpoint URL" to be the API Gateway URL from the venue deployment (see screeenshot below for example). <mark style="color:red;">NOTE: This may be needed until automation that does this, is fixed.</mark>\

8. SPS Team re-deploys SPS
9.  Re-add U-DS module to terraform state:

    <pre class="language-sh"><code class="lang-sh"><strong>terraform import &#x3C;bucket resource> &#x3C;bucket name>
    </strong></code></pre>



## <mark style="color:orange;">Steps to Verify a Successful Deployment:</mark>

1.  Verify the  Management Console is accessible through the shared services HTTPD:\
    `https://www.<SS_PREFIX>.mdps.mcp.nasa.gov:4443/${VENUE_PATH}/management/ui`

    **Development**: [`https://www.dev.mdps.mcp.nasa.gov:4443/unity/dev/management/ui`](https://www.dev.mdps.mcp.nasa.gov:4443/unity/dev/management/ui)&#x20;

    **Test**: [`https://www.test.mdps.mcp.nasa.gov:4443/unity/test/management/ui`](https://www.test.mdps.mcp.nasa.gov:4443/unity/test/management/ui)

    **Production**: [`https://www.mdps.mcp.nasa.gov:4443/unity/ops/management/ui`](https://www.mdps.mcp.nasa.gov:4443/unity/ops/management/ui)\

2. Verify you can access the UI Dashboard\

3. Verify the UI Dashboard is able to access the HealthCheck API, and is displaying statuses for each application.
