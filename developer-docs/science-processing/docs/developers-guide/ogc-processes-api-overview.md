# OGC Processes API Overview

The OGC (Open Spatial Consortium) Processes API is an international specification for executing remote processing of Earth Science data. The client (for example a program, or a user using a web user interface) makes HTTP requests to execute data processing on a remote server, passing all required information in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. The client-server interaction through the API is agnostic to the specific data processing engine implemented by the server.

This page provides a high-level overview of the functionality exposed by the API. Other pages contain specific examples of interaction using CURL (...) and Python (...). More detailed documentation on the API can be found on the \[OGC web page]\([https://ogcapi.ogc.org/processes/](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/processes/)).
